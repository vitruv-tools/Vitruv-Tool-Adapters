[Vitruv](https://vitruv.tools) is a framework for view-based software development. It assumes different models to be used for describing a software system,
which are automatically kept consistent by the framework and its applications. For general information on Vitruv, see our [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/vitruv-tools) and our [Wiki](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/.github/wiki).

This project contains adaptors for views, such that a V-SUM (Virtual Single Underlying Model) can be accessed from certain tools, such as the Eclipse IDE for modifying EMF model views.

## Installation

Vitruv can be installed in Eclipse via the [nightly update site](https://vitruv.tools/updatesite/nightly). A wiki page provides [detailed instructions for using or extending Vitruv](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/.github/wiki/Getting-Started).
